# Solution

1. First let the imput of string of characters be: AACTTTTGGCAAGGG (or whatever string of characters you have chosen for example)

2. Next sort the letters and label the letters by the number of repetitions 

    e.g. AA|C|TTTT|GG|C|AA|GGG
         
        12|1|1234|12|1|12|123

3. Then find out the largest number in your labelled string, which is $4$ in this case

4. Therefore the output, which is the length of the longest repetition, is $4$
